# Test Web page
Simple test web page with accessibility errors used for the usability test.
Host the html in order to scan it for errors using a11y.css and its modified version.
indexTestA.html is another version for the within-subjects usability test, that has other errors.

How to host:
- Install http-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) by running the command “npm install http-server -g” (installs it globally)
- Using command line, navigate to the folder containing the index.html
- run "http-server" in the command line
- If http-server was correctly installed, a command line output should appear.
- Use your browser to go to localhost:8080 or whatever port is shown in the command line output.

If you want to test the other version of the web page (indexTestA.html ) rename it to index.html
